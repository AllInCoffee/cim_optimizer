cim-optimizer
=============


This repository contains a reference implementation of a simulator of the Coherent Ising Machine (CIM). The CIM was `developed <https://doi.org/10.1038/s42254-022-00440-8>`_ as a photonic machine for heuristically solving Ising-optimization problems. Simulations of the CIM can be thought of as an unconventional, dynamical-systems-based, heuristic algorithm for solving Ising problems, which can compete with more conventional Ising-solving algorithms (such as simulated annealing, parallel tempering, and branch-and-bound).

There are two main intended audiences for this repository:


#. People who would like to use a state-of-the-art implementation of the CIM algorithm to heuristically solve Ising problems (for example, to benchmark the CIM approach against other heuristic approaches).
#. People who would like to study the workings of the CIM approach through simulation, and/or would like to have a quantitative model of CIM performance to make predictions about how future CIM hardware implementations will perform.

Most of the code in this repository resides within a Python file ``solve_Ising.py``. This repository is written in Python, and all input and result data for users is formatted in NumPy, while the source code uses PyTorch libraries for GPU acceleration. Several demonstration notebooks are provided in the Examples subsection, and showcase how to configure and run the solver function.

The goal of the CIM (and its simulation and variants) is to heuristically optimize the following :math:`N`-variable objective function (the classical :math:`N`-spin Ising Hamiltonian):

.. math::
   H = -\sum_{1\leq i < j \leq N} J_{ij}\sigma_i \sigma_j - \sum_{1 \leq i \leq N} h_i \sigma_i

where :math:`J` is an :math:`N \times N` coupling matrix and :math:`h` is an :math:`N`-dimensional vector representing the Zeeman external field. Each Ising spin is represented as :math:`\sigma_i \in \{ -1, 1\}`.

This repository uses solver algorithms adapted from:

All of the algorithms implemented are for classical models of the CIM. See https://doi.org/10.1364/QIM.2017.QW3B.2 and https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2613817 for examples of discussions of quantum models of the CIM, which are not implemented in this repository.

Please see the references within the cited papers for a fuller picture of the history and development of the Coherent-Ising-Machine appraoch to heuristically solving Ising problems, which was begun at Stanford University in the group of Yoshihisa Yamamoto circa 2010.
